<!DOCTYPE html><p><span class="leo">Leo</span>, the host of the system, is the guy who made
this site for the two of us.
He is demi-male and heterosexual, and prefers
<span class="pronoun he">he</span>/<span class="pronoun she">she</span> pronouns,
though <span class="pronoun any">any</span> pronouns are fine.
(We’ll use <span class="pronoun he">he</span> for consistency.)
He’s a student-programmer who likes to use <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> as his primary programming language,
though he is also proficient in <a href="https://kotlinlang.org">Kotlin</a>, Java, TypeScript and more.</p>
<p>He has since made contributions to the Rust language itself, especially in its standard library.
He also contributed to <a href="https://github.com/messloc/messloc"><code>messloc</code></a> and <a href="https://modrinth.com/user/leocth">Modrinth</a>’s backend service, <a href="https://github.com/modrinth/labrinth">Labrinth</a>.
He also used to make Minecraft mods, which are available on <a href="https://modrinth.com/user/leocth">Modrinth</a> and <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/members/leocth/projects">CurseForge</a>.</p>
