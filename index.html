                <p><h1 class="title is-1">Hello!</h1>
Iâ€™m <strong>Leah</strong> (LEE-uh), a self-styled community moderator ðŸ”¨ / coder ðŸ’» / amateur artist ðŸŽ¨ /
procrastinator ðŸ’¤ person.</p>
<p>I was born, raised and still live in China, and my mother tongue is Standard Chinese â€”
though nowadays I deem English my native language too.
Iâ€™m transfeminine, demiromantic, asexual, and I use feminine pronouns
(she/her/å¥¹) â€” please keep that in mind before interacting with me,
as I can only respect you if you respect me first :&gt;</p>
<p>I like to code, to draw, to discover myself, and to help others out while
they are discovering themselves.
More things I like include dogs and traffic cones. And linguistics. Especially
<abbr title="constructed languages (languages intentionally created by people)">conlangs</abbr>.
Theyâ€™re <em>very</em> cool.</p>
<h2>What Iâ€™m working on</h2>
<p>Currently, Iâ€™m busy working with <a href="https://quiltmc.org">QuiltMC</a> to create a safe,
inclusive space for modded Minecraft players and developers.
<a href="https://quiltmc.org/about/teams/#moderators">As one of Quiltâ€™s Moderators</a>,
I help keep the discriminatory, hurtful, problematic people out, and the respectful,
sincere, welcoming people in. So far, I think Iâ€™m doing an okay job.</p>
<p>I work with Quilt on a technical level too â€” I contribute code and reviews to
<a href="https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-kotlin-libraries">Quilt Kotlin Libraries (QKL)</a>,
a library allowing Kotlin users such as myself to use Quiltâ€™s APIs easier and more idiomatically.
I also help maintaining <a href="https://quiltmc.org">Quiltâ€™s website</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/QuiltMC/quiltmc.org/pull/58">including modernizing the codebase</a>
to be based on <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a> instead of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>.</p>
<p>Even though recently Iâ€™ve been using Kotlin, JavaScript, Sass and other languages as
a Quilt developer, Iâ€™m still a proud <a href="https://rust-lang.org/">Rustacean ðŸ¦€</a> at heart.
I often teach beginners in Rust how to improve their Rust skills and think in
the Rust mindset â€” both in real life and on platforms like
<a href="https://discord.gg/rust-lang-community">the Rust Community Discord Server</a> â€”
and Iâ€™m excited to see the people I helped become true Rust masters.</p>
<p>When Iâ€™m not busy moderating a community or coding or sitting in my chair idling,
I create drawings and paintings! Iâ€™m primarily an oil painter, though I use <a href="https://gimp.org">GIMP</a>
to create digital illustrations, like my own avatar and more.
